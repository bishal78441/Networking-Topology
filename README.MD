## Abstract

This project presents a comprehensive approach to network design and implementation for NetworkHats, focusing on the development of a robust three-tier architecture. The design addresses key aspects such as network security, VLAN implementation, routing protocols, and risk management. It also explores the use of modern technologies like software-defined networking (SDN) and network virtualization to enhance the overall performance, scalability, and security of the network.

## Conclusion

The network design for NetworkHats integrates advanced security measures, efficient routing protocols, and effective management of VLANs and other Layer 2 protocols. The project not only meets the current networking needs but also ensures scalability and adaptability to future requirements. By incorporating emerging trends and adhering to best practices in risk management and compliance, this network architecture provides a secure and reliable foundation for NetworkHatsâ€™ operations.
